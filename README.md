Homework - 4 

This homework consisted of writing a HTML/Javascript program that takes a JSON URL as input which contains Highest Grossing Films Information, the program then parses the JSON file and extracts the list of Highest Grossing Films, and displays them in a formatted table. All of the parsing and formatting is done with the help of Javascript that is embedded in HTML. It can be executed in any browser. It also handles the various error cases that can be present in a JSON.
